Project Progress Note â€” up to Day 10 (Week 2)

We are building AI Flight Planner â€” a browser-based demo for mission parsing + terrain-aware VTOL routes.
Repo: ai-flight-planner
Structure:

/backend â†’ Express server (proxies OpenAI + serves MapTiler config, hides keys).

/web/index.html â†’ frontend with MapLibre, mission parser, route drawing, safety checks, export.

/docs â†’ PLAN.md (8-week plan), CHANGELOG.md, meeting notes, etc.

Week 1 done

âœ… Day 4: AI Parsing MVP (OpenAI Responses API â†’ JSON schema, raw coord heuristics, geocode fallback).

âœ… Day 5: Terrain visualization with MapTiler DEM + clearance safety overlay.

Deliverable: demo-ready parsing + terrain route.

Week 2 done

âœ… Day 6: Improved parsing: multiple waypoints, altitude, photo interval, speed, avoid zones.

âœ… Day 7: Battery estimate (route distance, payload, wind penalty, time/percent calc). Optional panel.

âœ… Day 8: Multi-route candidates (Shortest, Safest, Efficient). Distinct colors, comparison table.

âœ… Day 9: Safety checklist (min altitude, clearance check, RTH, low-battery warning).

âœ… Day 10: Export support:

Mission Planner .waypoints (QGC WPL 110 text format).

QGroundControl .plan JSON.

Cleaned UI:

Start/End clicks drop visible pins with labels.

Three candidate routes appear distinctly.

Battery block collapsible (optional).

No 3D buildings errors.

Clear section headers (// CHAPTER ...) inside index.html.

Current Deliverable (end of Week 2)

Operators can enter text, coordinates, or click Start/End â†’ get route with safety overlay.

Can generate & compare 3 route options.

Safety checklist and optional battery estimates.

Export to Mission Planner & QGroundControl.

Keys safely hidden in backend.

Repo synced on GitHub (Farrukhy/ai-flight-planner).

Next Weeks (planned)

Week 3: Route efficiency, energy-aware optimization, elevation profiles.

Week 4: Export refinements, survey/camera tasks.

Week 5: NFZ & weather integration.

Week 6: Persistent missions + user accounts.

Week 7: Full UI polish.

Week 8: Demo release + deployment (Netlify/Vercel + Render backend).
